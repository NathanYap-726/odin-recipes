<h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Cheeses: 3/4 grated parmesan cheese and 1/2 cup mascarpone
            <br> 
            <!--Of course you'll need cheese. While this recipe does call for parmesan you can use any cheese of you're choice.<br> (Unless it's blue cheese,
            please don't use this. No one will survive that.) You'll also need mascarpone(or cream cheese) for the rich sauce.<!--> </li> 
            <br>
        <li>Flour: 1/4 cup flour 
            <br>
            <!--Cover the chicken throughly before browning for the perfect crisp.<!--> </li>
            <br>
        <li>Chicken: 8 skinless boneless chicken thighs 
            <br> 
            <!--If you didn't know chicken was needed for this recipe then I think you have other issues to worry about. Maybe start with instant noodles.<!--> </li>
            <br>
        <li>Seasonings: 1/2 teaspoon of salt and black pepper 
            <br>
            <!--If you don't want your chicken tasting like water then you'll need seasonings.<!--> </li>
            <br>
        <li>Oil: 2 tablespoons of olive oil 
            <br>
             <!--Brown the chicken in olive oil for best results.<!--></li>
            <br>
        <li>Garlic: 3 cloves garlic, minced
            <br>
            <!-- Three cloves to add that extra kick to your meal.<!--> </li>
            <br>
        <li>Broth: 1 3/4 cups of low sodium chicken broth 
            <br>
            <!--Use store or homemade chicken broth. Can never have enough chicken flavor<!--> </li>
            <br>
        <li>Lemon: <br> 1 teaspoon lemon zest <br> 3 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice <br> 4 lemon wedges for serving. 
            <br>
            <!--- Again if you didn't know this recipe requires lemons then you might want to start with somthing simpler. This recipe will use the entire lemon,<br> from the zest to the juice.<!-->  </li>
            <br>
        <li>Cornstarch: 1 tablespoon Cornstarch
            <br>
            <!----Make a slurry with the cornstarch and add to the mixutre to thicken the sauce later.<!--></li>
            <br>
        <li>Herbs: Chopped oregano to taste 
            <br>
            <!--Used to garnish the dish at the end for a nice pop of colour.<!--></li>
    </ul>
    <!--- I decided to make changes to remove random bits in the ingredients list because I felt at the end of the day I don't want to have to filter that nonsense when wanting to cook dinner.
        I did however keep them in just incase  decide to change my mind on the matter. <!-->

    <h3>How to make the Lemon Parmesan Chicken</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> Mix 1/4 cup of Parmesan with flour and season the chicken.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Cover the chicken in the flour mixture.</li>
        <br>
        <li> Brown the chicken on all sides and remove from skillet. After all the chicken is browned use the oil still in pan to cook the garlic.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Mix the broth, mascarpone, lemon zest and juice, and remaining parmesan. </li>
        <br>
        <li>Add the mixture to the skillet and bring to a boil.</li>
        <br>
        <li> Make a cornstarch slurry and whisk into the broth mixture</li>
        <br>
        <li>Add the chicken back into the mixutre and cook until no longer pink. Depending on the thickness of the chicken thigh take extra precaution <br> in making sure it is throughly cooked. You could also cut the chikcen into pieces before putting into mixture to make it cook faster.</li>
        <br>
        <li> Plate and garnish with the herbs of your choosing and place a lemon wedge on the side.</li>
