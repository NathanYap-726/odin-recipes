<h1> Cremy Lemon Parmesan Chicken</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
    <p> This lemon Parmesan chicken recipe is an “easy, yet impressive, dish to accomplish,” according to recipe tester Nathan.  </p>
        
    <p> A nice chicken with some cheese and lemon. A meal that can be made so quick even a child could do this with a blindfold.</p>
    <p> <strong>(Please don't actually have a child alone in the kitchen without supervision)</strong> </p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Cheese:Of course you'll need cheese. While this recipe does call for parmesan you can use any cheese of you're choice.<br> (Unless it's blue cheese,
            please don't use this. No one will survive that.) </li>
            <p></p>
        <li>Flour: Cover the chicken throughly before browning for the perfect crisp.</li>
            </p></p>
        <li>Chicken: If you didn't know chicken was needed for this recipe then I think you have other issues to worry about. Maybe start with instant noodles.<br>You'll need 8 boneless skinless chicken thighs which will make approximately 4 servings. </li>
            <p></p>
        <li>Seasonings: If you don't want your chicken tasting like water then you'll need seasonings. Season the chicken with salt and black pepper. </li>
            <p></p>
        <li>Oil: Brown the chicken in olive oil for best results.</li>
            <p></p>
        <li>Garlic: Three cloves to add that extra kick to your meal. </li>
            <p></p>
        <li>Broth: Use store or homemade chicken broth. Can never have enough chicken flavor</li>
            <p></p>
        <li>Lemon: Again if you didn't know this recipe requires lemons then you might want to start with somthing simpler. This recipe will use the entire lemon,<br> from the zest to the juice.  </li>
            <p></p>
        <li>Cornstarch: Make a slurry with the cornstarch and add to the mixutre to thicken the sauce later.</li>
            <p></p>
        <li>Herbs: Used to garnish the dish at the end for a nice pop of colour.</li>
    </ul>
