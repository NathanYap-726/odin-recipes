This project will teach me the basics of html and git. 
I should be comfortably able to use html and git to create things by the end.hopefully

So the first recipe (creamy lemon parmesan) page was super messy and almost a disaster. The 2nd one is much cleaner and easier on the eyes to look at. 
I might clean things up because it seriously looks horrible, but I just might leave things be so it shows how much I've progressed with each new page.
